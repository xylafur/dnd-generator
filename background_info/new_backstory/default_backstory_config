#This is the default backstory file, it will be used unless another is
#specified

#lines beginning with the '#' character will be ignored by the parser

#The first thing that the parser expects is a field in brackets like this

[BIRTHPLACE]

#then this is the percentage for each field, in this case meaning that there is
#a 25% chance the player lived in a regular home

25 in a regular home
25 in a medical place via a doctor
10 in the home of a witchdoctor
10 outside
10 on a ship while your parent(s) were traveling
5 in from of a live audience
5 on another plane
5 unknown

#and as you can see, the chance of being born in one of these strange places is
#very low
1 in the lab of a crazy wizard
1 in a basement while your parents were hiding from someone or something
1 in a field during a battle
1 in a sewer
1 in a Castle

#there are also many other neat little features that can be used in the config

[FAMILY_WEALTH]

#you will see that sometimes, keeping track of the total of a previous field is
#important to later ones

#because of this, the parser will automatically keep track of the total of each
#field

#you can present the percentages in a particular way to take advantage of this
#if you undertand a little about how the parser works

#the parser adds up the running total, and uses that against the random value
#it came up with.  THis random value will always be between 1 and 100
#This is just because we use out of 100% by default

#if goes in order.  So if the value if between 1 and 5 (inclusive) it will
#result in the player having no worldly possesions

#but if you grow up in a poor childhood, it wouldn't make sense to live in a
#castle

5 you had almost no money during your childhood, as well as no worldly posessions
10 you lived squalid lifestyle, you lived a very economically challenging childhood
10 you lived a poor childhood lower class
25 You lived a modest lifestyle, lower middle class
25 You lived a comfortable lifestyle, upper middle class
10 you lived a wealthy childhood, upper class
10 you lived an aristocratic lifestyle as a child
5 you grew up with a family that had more money and possesions than to know what to do

#thats why we can and subtract the values of previous fields from the random
#value that the parser comes up with

[CHILDHOOD_HOME]

#we can use + and - to add and subtract values to and from what we tolled

#you can pass in a valid mathmatecal expression like so

#this is based on a quadratic fit I did to get proper scaling

#y = -12 + 2.8 * x - .05 * x + .00045 * x**3
+ FAMILY_WEALTH

#so in this case, whatever we had for our family wealth (lets use the eample of
#before of 5, meaning we grew up with no worly possesions, we would add that to
#our roll.

#but then you might think what happens if we roll a number that results in
#something less than or greater than 100?

#well that is why we can use these symbols

#if total that we rolled plus all the other values we added in is less than 1
< on the streets
#if it is greater than 100
> in a Palace or Castle

#and then these are just the regular parcentages

5 in a rundown shack
10 no permenent residence, had to move from broken home to broken home
10 some encampment or village in the wilderness
25 in a small house
25 in a large house
10 on a plantation with much land, a very nice home
10 in a mansion
5 in a mansion in the most thriving part of your home

#please note that all of these modifiers must come before the percentages and
#values
